### Abstract

	Young Americans vote at very low rates. A number of theories have been proposed to explain low youth voter turnout, ranging from the lack of habitual voting to simple laziness and apathy. However, the effect of descriptive representation on youth turnout has been little studied. It is possible that young people do not vote because they do not have the option to vote for other young people with whom they identify. This study examined the hypothesis that young candidates increase youth turnout by analyzing candidates ages and turnout data from the 2014 midterm US House elections in New York.  It finds a statistically significant positive relationship between young candidates and youth turnout. Far from being lazy or apathetic, it is possible young voters are just turning out according to descriptive representation theory.
